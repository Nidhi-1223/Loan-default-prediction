# Loan Default Prediction

A personâ€™s creditworthiness is often associated (conversely) with the likelihood they may default on loans. Looking at data on loan applicants, useful insights are extracted to guide a business towards decisions. 

The data is about 1000 loan applications, along with a certain set of attributes about the applicant itself, and whether they were considered high risk. <br> 
**Note** : It is worse to state an applicant as a low credit risk when they are actually a high risk
